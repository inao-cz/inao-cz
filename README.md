# Hello. My name is inao.
I'm 21 yo someone from Czech Republic (Or Czechia if you want to trigger everyone living in my country), trying to code useful stuff. And sometimes it works, that's suprising.

If you want to call me using my real life name, you can call me base64_decode("SmFrdWI="); (That was unexpected 👀)

# Skills?
Well 🤔, I'm still in process of learning a lot. But I'd confidentially say that my Java skills aren't the lowest and the same goes for PHP. It's different story about other popular languages like Python (I hate this language. War can start now 🤯). But I'm trying to learn Rust these days and one day, maybe even C++.

# Interests
Outside of IT in general (I can build you a PC, choose you a networking device or develop something), I enjoy talking about cars but I'm not a 👨‍🔧. Also I'm interested about money and how stocks markets work.

Currently experimenting with Web3 using IPFS
