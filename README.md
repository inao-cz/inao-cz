# Hello. My name is inao.
I'm a 23-year-old from the Czech Republic (or Czechia, if you want to trigger everyone who lives in my country) who tries to code useful things. And sometimes it works, which is surprising..

# Skills?
Well ü§î, I'm still learning a lot. But I can confidently say that my Java skills aren't the lowest, and the same goes for PHP. It's a different story with other popular languages like Python (I hate this language. War can start now ü§Ø). Cuurently also learning Go and Rust.

# Interests
Outside of IT in general (I can build you a PC, choose you a network device or develop something), I like to talk about cars, but I'm not a üë®‚Äçüîß. I'm also interested in money and how the stock market works.

# Contact
